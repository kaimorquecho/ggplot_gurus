# data_read.R script includes the raw data we read from our group project folder in workbench-1

# clean_data.R script cleans raw data into only the variables that we want to keep for each site (bq1, bq2, bq3, prm)

# create data_viz.R script to write script for data vizualization

# removed "is.na(TRUE)", caused issues when reading in data

# used full join() and select() to join data tables by sample date to be left with two data frames - one for K and one for NO3 for the set of sample dates
